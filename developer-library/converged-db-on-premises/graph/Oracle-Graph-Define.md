# Oracle Graph 

## Introduction 

**Defining and creating the graph representation**

This section describes how the above tables were modeled as a graph and how the graph representation is generated from them. 

**Note:** This is just a quick and simplified model for illustrative purposes. It includes ORDERS as a vertex entity for convenience. It is possible to model and generate a more compact graph for the same set of tables and relationships between the tables. That model, and process, will be included in an advanced version of this lab.

A first cut at a graph model simply examines the primary key/foreign key relationships and uses the foreign keys to define the edges. 

In this instance the Vertex (or Node) entities are CUSTOMERS, ORDERS, STORES, and PRODUCTS. 
While the Edge(s) are CUSTOMER ORDERED (from CUSTOMERS to ORDERS), ORDERED BY (the reverse edge from ORDERS to CUSTOMERS), ORDERED FROM STORE (ORDERS to STORES), STORE GOT ORDER (STORES to ORDERS), ORDER HAS PRODUCT (ORDERS to PRODUCTS), and PRODUCT IN ORDER (PRODUCTS to ORDERS)

## Before You Begin

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
- Lab 1:  Login to Oracle Cloud
- Lab 2:  Generate SSH Key
- Lab 3:  Create Compute instance 
- Lab 4:  Environment setup
- Note :  Below steps are pre-configured in the image.
- The Oracle Graph Server and Graph Client must be installed.
- Max string size parameter should be set to extended.
- AL16UTF16 (instead of UTF8) must be specified as the NLS NCHAR CHARACTERSET.
- AL32UTF8 (UTF8) should be the default character set, but AL16UTF16 must be the NLS NCHAR CHARACTERSET.


**What Do You Need?**

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
- Lab 1:  Login to Oracle Cloud
- Lab 2:  Generate SSH Key


## Step 1: Make a JDBC connection to the database:
At the jshell prompt.

````
<copy>
var jdbcUrl ="jdbc:oracle:thin:@<instance_ip_address>:<DB_Port>/<PDB_Name>";
var user = "graphuser";
var pass = "graphuser";
var conn = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, user, pass) ;
</copy>
````

**Set auto commit to false. **

This is needed for PGQL DDL and other queries.

````
<copy>
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
</copy>
````

## Step 2: Get a PgqlConnection 

This will run PGQL queries directly against the VT$ (vertex) and GE$ (edge) tables 
````
<copy>
var pgql = PgqlConnection.getConnection(conn);
</copy>
````

## Step 3: Create View

Create the required views first for the use of orders and order_items as multiple edge tables. Execute these in sqlplus :

````
<copy>
Create or replace view co_edge as select * from orders;
Create or replace view oc_edge as select * from orders;
Create or replace view os_edge as select * from orders;
Create or replace view so_edge as select * from orders;
Create or replace view op_edge as select * from order_items;
Create or replace view po_edge as select * from order_items;
</copy>
````

## Step 4: Use property graph query language(PGQL)

We will use a property graph query language [PGQL](http://pgql-lang.org) DDL to define and populate the graph.  The statement is as follows:

````
<copy>
CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH OE_SAMPLE_GRAPH
  VERTEX TABLES (
    customers KEY (CUSTOMER_ID) LABEL CUSTOMERS 
PROPERTIES(CUSTOMER_ID, EMAIL_ADDRESS, FULL_NAME),
    products KEY (PRODUCT_ID) LABEL PRODUCTS 
PROPERTIES (PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, UNIT_PRICE),
    orders KEY (ORDER_ID) LABEL ORDERS 
PROPERTIES (ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATETIME, ORDER_STATUS),
    stores KEY (STORE_ID) LABEL STORES 
PROPERTIES (STORE_ID, STORE_NAME, WEB_ADDRESS, PHYSICAL_ADDRESS, 
LATITUDE, LONGITUDE)
  )
  EDGE TABLES (
    co_edge
      SOURCE KEY (CUSTOMER_ID) REFERENCES customers
      DESTINATION KEY (ORDER_ID) REFERENCES orders
      LABEL CUSTOMER_ORDERED
      NO PROPERTIES,
    oc_edge
      SOURCE KEY (ORDER_ID) REFERENCES orders
      DESTINATION KEY (CUSTOMER_ID) REFERENCES customers
      LABEL ORDERED_BY
      NO PROPERTIES,
    os_edge 
      SOURCE KEY (ORDER_ID) REFERENCES orders
      DESTINATION KEY (STORE_ID) REFERENCES stores
      LABEL ORDERED_FROM_STORE
      NO PROPERTIES,
    so_edge 
      SOURCE KEY (STORE_ID) REFERENCES stores
      DESTINATION KEY (ORDER_ID) REFERENCES orders
      LABEL STORE_GOT_ORDER
      NO PROPERTIES,
    op_edge 
      SOURCE KEY (ORDER_ID) REFERENCES orders
      DESTINATION KEY (PRODUCT_ID) REFERENCES products
      LABEL ORDER_HAS_PRODUCT
      PROPERTIES (LINE_ITEM_ID, UNIT_PRICE, QUANTITY),
    po_edge 
      SOURCE KEY (PRODUCT_ID) REFERENCES products
      DESTINATION KEY (ORDER_ID) REFERENCES orders
      LABEL PRODUCT_IN_ORDER
      PROPERTIES (LINE_ITEM_ID)
  )
</copy>
````

Save the above PQGL query as sql file (CreatePropertyGraph.sql) and then run the below command at jshell.

**create the graph-**

````
<copy>
pgql.prepareStatement(Files.readString(Paths.get("/u01/CreatePropertyGraph.sql"))).execute();
</copy>
````

The Graph Server kit includes the necessary components (a server application and JShell client) that will execute the above CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement and create the graph representation. 

The graph itself is stored in a set of tables named 

![](./images/g7.png)  

![](./images/IMGG7.PNG) 

The important ones are the ones that store the vertices (OE SAMPLE GRAPHVT$) and edges (OE SAMPLE GRAPHGE$).

Letâ€™s look at the number of vertices and edges in the graph. 

**SQL query**

There will be multiple entries with the same vid one each for the labels and properties.

````
<copy>
select count(distinct vid) from oe_sample_graphvt$ ;
</copy>
````
(Vid is the vertex id.)

There can be multiple entries with the same eid one each for the label and properties.

````
<copy>
select count(distinct eid) from oe_sample_graphge$;
</copy>
````

(eid is the edge id)

Create a convenience function which prepares, executes, and prints the result of a PGQL statement

````
<copy>
Consumer<String> query = q -> { try(var s = pgql.prepareStatement(q)) { s.execute(); s.getResultSet().print(); } catch(Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } }
</copy>
````
